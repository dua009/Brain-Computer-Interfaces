# Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Papers #
This repo contains some of my lab reports from BCI experiments, primarily focused on measuring and analyzing EEG signals. I took this course to gain hands-on experience with signal processing, and I really enjoyed working with real EEG data and seeing how classification techniques apply to BCIs.
